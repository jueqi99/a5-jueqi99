# a5-data-report
In this assignment, you'll complete the instructions **on Canvas** to demonstrate you ability to leverage `R Markdown` to build a report based on crowd-sourced mass shootings in the U.S. in 2018.  

Please **edit this README.md** file to include a link to your hosted report (this will **earn you points** and make **grading easier**). When you're finished, please make sure to **submit this GitHub URL** to Canvas on time for credit.

I couldn't access the settings page on the a5-jueqi99 repository created in the info201a-s19 organization, so I had to create my own repository to render the index.html document as a website.
